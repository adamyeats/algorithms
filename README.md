# Algorithms

A collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in TypeScript.

These are implemented for my own learning purposes, but I hope they can be useful to others as well. They were mostly written during coding challenges and interviews, so they are not necessarily the most efficient implementations.

## Development

This project requires **at least Node.js v18**.

### Installation

### Testing

The tests for this library use [Jest](https://jestjs.io) as the test runner. Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the following command in the root of this repository to run the tests:
